# Bootstrap3 Modal for F2

	Note: this library is an experimental plugin targeting a future release
	of F2. It is not intended for production use. You have been warned!

This is a drop-in plugin that will replace the existing `F2.UI.alert` and
`F2.UI.confirm` dialogs with Bootstrap3 modals.

## Requirements

- [jQuery >= 1.9.1](http://jquery.com/)
- [bootstrap-modal.js](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals)
- [F2 >= 1.5](http://www.openf2.org)

## Installation

Simply load the `f2-plugin-bootstrap-modal.js` script on a page that
includes the above requirements in the global namespace.
